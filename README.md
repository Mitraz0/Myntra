# Myntra Contest Project 
This project integrates a dynamic contest for designers within the Myntra platform, fostering creativity and competition among fashion designers. Each week, designers will have the opportunity to showcase their talent and gain visibility while users can actively participate in the fashion community through voting, reviews, and social media engagement.

Features
Weekly Contests: Running every Monday to Sunday, providing fresh opportunities for designers to compete and showcase their designs based on a new theme each week.

Theme-Based Competition: Designers compete based on a weekly theme presented by Myntra, such as Retro Revival, Streetwear Culture, or other trendy topics.

Participants: Each week, three designers are selected to showcase three of their designs, offering a focused and high-quality competition.

Virtual Fashion Show: Short ramp walk videos of the designs are created for users to watch and vote on, bringing a virtual runway experience to their screens.

Voting and Rewards: Users vote for their favorite designs, and the designer with the most votes at the end of the week becomes the face of Myntra for the month. The winning designer also gets the opportunity to sell their designs on the platform.

User Interaction: Users can engage with the designs by swiping left or right, indicating their preferences.

User Reviews and Ratings: Users can leave reviews and rate the designs, providing valuable feedback for the designers.

Purchase Options: Each video features options for users to add the design to their wishlist, purchase, or rent, making it easy to acquire their favorite looks.

Social Media Integration: Users are encouraged to share their favorite designs on social media, increasing visibility and participation in the contest.

Exclusive Rewards: Regular voters receive exclusive discounts or early access to the winning designs, incentivizing continuous engagement.
